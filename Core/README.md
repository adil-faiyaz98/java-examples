# Java Exception Handling Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating Java's exception handling mechanisms, focusing on the `try-catch-finally` blocks and related concepts.

## Exception Handling Concepts

### Types of Exceptions in Java

1. **Checked Exceptions**
   - Subclasses of `Exception` (excluding `RuntimeException`)
   - Must be either caught or declared in method signature
   - Examples: `IOException`, `SQLException`, `ClassNotFoundException`

2. **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions)**
   - Subclasses of `RuntimeException`
   - Don't need to be explicitly caught or declared
   - Examples: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ArithmeticException`

3. **Errors**
   - Subclasses of `Error`
   - Typically unrecoverable and shouldn't be caught
   - Examples: `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`

### Exception Handling Mechanisms

1. **try-catch**
   - Basic mechanism to handle exceptions
   - Code that might throw an exception goes in the `try` block
   - Exception handling code goes in the `catch` block

2. **try-catch-finally**
   - `finally` block contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred
   - Used for cleanup operations (closing resources, etc.)

3. **try-with-resources**
   - Introduced in Java 7
   - Automatically closes resources that implement `AutoCloseable`
   - Simplifies resource management and ensures proper cleanup

4. **Multi-catch**
   - Introduced in Java 7
   - Allows catching multiple exception types in a single catch block
   - Reduces code duplication

5. **throw and throws**
   - `throw` is used to explicitly throw an exception
   - `throws` is used in method signatures to declare that a method might throw certain exceptions

## Best Practices for Exception Handling

1. **Only Catch Exceptions You Can Handle**
   - Don't catch exceptions if you can't take meaningful action

2. **Don't Swallow Exceptions**
   - Always log or handle exceptions properly
   - Never use empty catch blocks in production code

3. **Use Specific Exception Types**
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than general ones
   - Order catch blocks from most specific to most general

4. **Use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable Resources**
   - Ensures resources are properly closed even if exceptions occur

5. **Include Meaningful Information in Exceptions**
   - Use descriptive error messages
   - Include relevant context in custom exceptions

6. **Clean Up Resources in finally Blocks**
   - When not using try-with-resources, use finally for cleanup

7. **Preserve the Original Exception**
   - When re-throwing, use exception chaining to preserve the original cause
