# Repository Design Pattern

## Intent
Mediate between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

## Problem
How do we decouple the domain model from the data access logic while providing a consistent interface for working with domain objects?

Some challenges the Repository pattern addresses:
- Domain logic becomes tightly coupled to data access code
- Testing domain logic is difficult when it directly accesses the database
- Switching data sources requires changes throughout the codebase
- Query logic is scattered across the application
- Domain objects are exposed to persistence concerns

## Solution
The Repository pattern solves this by:
1. Creating a repository interface that provides a collection-like interface for domain objects
2. Implementing concrete repositories for specific data sources
3. Keeping domain logic isolated from data access implementation
4. Centralizing query logic in the repository
5. Using the repository as an abstraction layer between domain and data mapping layers

## Differences from DAO Pattern
While similar, the Repository pattern differs from the DAO pattern in several ways:
- **Abstraction Level**: Repositories work at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with domain objects and aggregates
- **Collection-Like Interface**: Repositories provide a more collection-like interface (add, remove, find)
- **Domain Focus**: Repositories are more focused on the domain model, while DAOs are more focused on the data source
- **Query Methods**: Repositories often include domain-specific query methods

## Structure

1. **Domain Entity**
   - Represents a domain object with business logic
   - Example: `Product` class

2. **Repository Interface**
   - Defines collection-like methods for accessing domain objects
   - Example: `ProductRepository` interface

3. **Repository Implementation**
   - Implements the repository interface for a specific data source
   - Example: `InMemoryProductRepository` class

4. **Service Layer**
   - Uses the repository to implement business logic
   - Example: `ProductService` class

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates domain logic from data access logic
- **Testability**: Makes unit testing easier through repository interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes data access logic
- **Flexibility**: Makes it easy to switch between different data sources
- **Domain Focus**: Keeps the focus on the domain model
- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent interface for working with domain objects

## When to Use

- When you want to focus on the domain model
- When you need a collection-like interface for domain objects
- When you want to centralize query logic
- When you need to switch between different data sources
- When you want to test domain logic in isolation

## Real-World Examples

- Spring Data repositories
- Entity Framework repositories in .NET
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) repositories
- Hibernate repositories
- Repository implementations in enterprise applications

## Implementation Considerations

- **Aggregate Roots**: In DDD, repositories are typically created for aggregate roots only
- **Query Methods**: Consider adding domain-specific query methods to the repository interface
- **Caching**: Repositories can implement caching strategies
- **Transaction Management**: Consider how transactions will be managed across repository operations
- **Specification Pattern**: Can be combined with the Specification pattern for complex queries

## Related Patterns

- **DAO Pattern**: Similar but focused on data access rather than domain objects
- **Unit of Work**: Often used with repositories to track changes
- **Factory Pattern**: Can be used to create repositories
- **Specification Pattern**: Can be used with repositories for complex queries
