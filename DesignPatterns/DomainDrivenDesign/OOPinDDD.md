# Object-Oriented Programming in Domain-Driven Design

This implementation demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles are applied in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The code showcases the following OOP principles:

## 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.

**Examples:**
- Private fields with public getters in `Customer` and `Order` classes
- Validation of invariants in constructors and methods
- Domain events encapsulated within aggregate roots

## 2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class, establishing an "is-a" relationship.

**Examples:**
- `Entity<ID>` base class for all entities
- `AggregateRoot<ID>` extending `Entity<ID>` for aggregate roots
- `Customer` and `Order` extending `AggregateRoot`

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with methods being called based on the actual object type.

**Examples:**
- `PaymentProcessor` interface with different implementations (`CreditCardProcessor`, `PayPalProcessor`, `BankTransferProcessor`)
- Different behavior based on `OrderStatus` (State pattern)
- Domain events implementing the `DomainEvent` interface

## 4. Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

**Examples:**
- `Entity` and `AggregateRoot` abstract classes
- `ValueObject` interface
- `PaymentProcessor` interface

## 5. Design Patterns

Several OOP design patterns are used in the implementation:

### Factory Pattern
- `PaymentProcessorFactory` creates appropriate payment processors based on payment method type

### State Pattern
- `OrderStatus` enum represents different states of an order
- Order behavior changes based on its status

### Repository Pattern
- `CustomerRepository` and `OrderRepository` provide collection-like interfaces for domain objects

### Value Object Pattern
- Immutable objects like `CustomerId`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Money`

## 6. SOLID Principles

The implementation follows SOLID principles:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has a single responsibility (e.g., `Customer` manages customer data, `PaymentProcessor` handles payments)

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Classes are open for extension but closed for modification (e.g., new payment processors can be added without modifying existing code)

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes can be substituted for their base types (e.g., any `PaymentProcessor` implementation can be used where a `PaymentProcessor` is expected)

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients are not forced to depend on interfaces they don't use (e.g., specific interfaces for different responsibilities)

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations (e.g., services depend on repository interfaces, not implementations)

## 7. Domain Events

Domain events are used to communicate between different parts of the system:

- `CustomerCreatedEvent`
- `CustomerUpdatedEvent`
- `PaymentMethodAddedEvent`
- `PaymentMethodRemovedEvent`
- `OrderPlacedEvent`

These events demonstrate how to implement the Observer pattern in a domain-driven way, allowing loose coupling between components.

## Conclusion

This implementation shows how OOP principles and patterns can be effectively applied in a Domain-Driven Design context to create a maintainable, flexible, and expressive domain model that accurately reflects the business domain.
