# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation

## Overview
This example demonstrates a Domain-Driven Design implementation for an e-commerce system. It showcases key DDD concepts including:

- Bounded Contexts
- Entities and Value Objects
- Aggregates and Aggregate Roots
- Repositories
- Domain Services
- Application Services
- Domain Events
- Ubiquitous Language

## Structure

The implementation follows a layered architecture:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains the core business logic and domain model
   - Includes entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, and domain events
   - Independent of infrastructure and application concerns

2. **Application Layer**
   - Orchestrates the domain objects to perform application tasks
   - Implements use cases using domain objects
   - Coordinates transactions and security
   - Translates between domain and external representations

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Provides technical capabilities to support the higher layers
   - Implements repositories, persistence, messaging, etc.
   - Contains adapters for external services

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Handles user interface concerns
   - Translates user input into application commands
   - Formats application output for display

## Key DDD Concepts

### Bounded Contexts
The example demonstrates two bounded contexts:
- **Order Management**: Handles orders, order items, and order processing
- **Customer Management**: Handles customer information and customer relationships

### Entities and Value Objects
- **Entities**: Objects with identity (e.g., Order, Customer)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity (e.g., Address, Money)

### Aggregates and Aggregate Roots
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of related objects treated as a unit (e.g., Order with OrderItems)
- **Aggregate Roots**: Entry points to aggregates (e.g., Order is the root of the Order aggregate)

### Repositories
Provide methods to access and persist aggregates (e.g., OrderRepository)

### Domain Services
Encapsulate domain logic that doesn't naturally fit into entities or value objects (e.g., OrderProcessingService)

### Application Services
Coordinate domain objects to implement use cases (e.g., OrderApplicationService)

### Domain Events
Represent significant occurrences in the domain (e.g., OrderPlacedEvent)

## Implementation Notes

- The code uses a rich domain model with behavior encapsulated in domain objects
- Immutability is used for value objects to ensure integrity
- Repositories work with aggregate roots only
- Domain events are used for communication between bounded contexts
- The ubiquitous language is reflected in the naming of classes and methods

## Running the Example

The example includes a `Main.java` file that demonstrates the e-commerce system in action, showing:
1. Creating a new customer
2. Creating and placing an order
3. Processing payment
4. Shipping the order
5. Handling domain events
