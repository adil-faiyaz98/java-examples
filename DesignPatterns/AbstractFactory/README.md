# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Intent
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem
How do we create a system that is independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented?

For example, when developing a cross-platform UI toolkit, we need to ensure that UI components match the operating system they're running on. We want to:
- Create families of related objects (e.g., UI components for a specific OS)
- Ensure these families are used together
- Isolate concrete classes from client code

## Solution
The Abstract Factory pattern solves this by:
1. Defining interfaces for creating each distinct product
2. Creating an abstract factory interface with methods for creating products
3. Implementing concrete factories for each product family
4. Having client code work with factories and products through their abstract interfaces

## Structure

This example demonstrates creating UI components for different operating systems:

1. **Abstract Products**
   - `Button` - Interface for all buttons
   - `Checkbox` - Interface for all checkboxes

2. **Concrete Products**
   - `WindowsButton`, `MacOSButton` - OS-specific button implementations
   - `WindowsCheckbox`, `MacOSCheckbox` - OS-specific checkbox implementations

3. **Abstract Factory**
   - `UIFactory` - Interface with methods to create abstract products

4. **Concrete Factories**
   - `WindowsUIFactory` - Creates Windows UI components
   - `MacOSUIFactory` - Creates MacOS UI components

5. **Client**
   - Works with factories and products only through abstract interfaces

## Benefits

- **Isolation**: Client code works only with abstract interfaces
- **Consistency**: Ensures products from the same family are used together
- **Single Responsibility**: Each factory encapsulates the creation logic for a family of products
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New product families can be added without changing existing code

## When to Use

- When a system should be independent of how its products are created
- When a system should work with multiple families of products
- When you want to provide a library of products without exposing implementation details
- When related products must be used together

## Real-World Examples

- UI toolkits for different platforms
- Database connectors for different database systems
- Different rendering engines in a graphics application
- Vehicle factories producing different types of vehicles
