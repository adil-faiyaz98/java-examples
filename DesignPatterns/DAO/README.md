# Data Access Object (DAO) Design Pattern

## Intent
Separate the data access logic from business logic by providing an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanism.

## Problem
How do we abstract and encapsulate all access to a data source, managing the connection and handling CRUD operations?

Some challenges the DAO pattern addresses:
- Coupling business logic directly to data access code makes it hard to change the persistence mechanism
- Mixing business and data access logic reduces code clarity and maintainability
- Testing business logic becomes difficult when it's tightly coupled to data access
- Different data sources require different access methods

## Solution
The DAO pattern solves this by:
1. Creating a DAO interface that defines the standard operations to be performed on a model object
2. Implementing concrete DAO classes for specific data sources
3. Keeping the business logic isolated from the data access implementation
4. Using model objects to transfer data between the DAO and the business logic

## Structure

1. **Model/Entity**
   - Represents the data structure
   - Contains getters and setters for its properties
   - Example: `User` class

2. **DAO Interface**
   - Defines standard operations to be performed on a model object
   - Typically includes CRUD operations
   - Example: `UserDAO` interface

3. **DAO Implementation**
   - Implements the DAO interface for a specific data source
   - Handles the details of connecting to and manipulating the data source
   - Example: `UserDAOImpl` class

4. **Client**
   - Uses the DAO interface to interact with the data source
   - Remains isolated from the data access implementation details
   - Example: The main method in `DAOPattern`

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates business logic from data access logic
- **Abstraction**: Hides the complexity of data access operations
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates all data access in one place
- **Flexibility**: Makes it easy to switch between different data sources
- **Testability**: Allows for easier unit testing through mocking or stubbing the DAO
- **Maintainability**: Centralizes data access code, making it easier to maintain

## When to Use

- When you need to access data from various sources (databases, web services, files)
- When you want to isolate your business logic from data access implementation details
- When you need to support multiple database types
- When you want to unit test your business logic without hitting the actual database
- When you need to implement caching strategies for data access

## Real-World Examples

- Java Persistence API (JPA) repositories
- Spring Data repositories
- Hibernate DAO implementations
- Database access layers in enterprise applications
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks

## Implementation Considerations

- **Transaction Management**: Consider how transactions will be managed across multiple DAO operations
- **Connection Pooling**: For database DAOs, consider using connection pooling for efficiency
- **Exception Handling**: Implement consistent exception handling for data access errors
- **Caching**: Consider adding caching to improve performance
- **Thread Safety**: Ensure thread safety for DAOs used in multi-threaded environments

## Related Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Similar to DAO but typically works at a higher level of abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Often used to create DAO instances
- **Singleton Pattern**: Sometimes used to ensure a single DAO instance
- **Proxy Pattern**: Can be used to add caching or lazy loading to DAOs
